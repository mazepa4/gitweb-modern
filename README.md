# gitweb-modern
New modern look of gitweb for Apache2. Added repository url on summary view and last commit on the footer.<br />
Themes were taken from those repositories:<br />
  https://github.com/troglobit/gitweb-theme.git<br />
  https://github.com/kogakure/gitweb-theme.git<br />
Added small modification to them. See demo below.<br />
